# 🧪 Machine Learning Foundations: From Data to Intelligence

> "The journey from a pencil and paper to the Tesla Gigafactory taught me that complexity is built on solid foundations."

This repository is a dedicated space for my **Machine Learning** transition. Having mastered the "Data Stack" (Python, NumPy, Pandas, SQL), I am now building the core mathematical and algorithmic foundations required for Deep Learning and Agentic AI.

## 🗺️ The Learning Roadmap

This repo follows a structured path toward becoming an AI Engineer:

1.  **Data Proficiency (Complete):** Python, NumPy, Pandas, SQL, Excel.
2.  **ML Foundations (Current):** Supervised/Unsupervised Learning, Feature Engineering, Scikit-Learn.
3.  **Deep Learning (Next):** Neural Networks, PyTorch/TensorFlow.
4.  **Agentic Systems (Target):** Autonomous agents and design patterns (IIT Roorkee).

## 📊 My Philosophy
I am a Software Engineering student at the **University of Europe, Potsdam**. I am no longer focused on Backend/Java; my energy is now 100% dedicated to the intersection of **Software Engineering and AI**.

**Current Status:** Building the statistical intuition needed to understand how machines truly "learn."
